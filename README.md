 a peak/trough-analog min/median/max module...

2408310019

this is a slightly interesting one - clearly this started as two separate module and then got cobbled together into abit of a monster but i suspect its got more legs yet and could really turn into something even more original and special.

it seems to consist of a min/median/max module - asolute classic analog logic tool a nd stalwart feature of any good patch programmable system - but nailed on the end is a peak/trough detector with a noice feature set of rising/falling/steady/moving outs.
it's definitely got legs as something but i'd like to find a away to make it far more unique and intersting than just plain old analog logic basics as is.
it's yet another candidate wth high possibilities as part of the jacob's ladder projecgt but i don't know if there's room fo all the functionality this offers in such a mdoule as that.

we'll have to watch and wait with baited breath, eh?
